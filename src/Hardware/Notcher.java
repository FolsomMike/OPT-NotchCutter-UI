* Title: Notcher.java
* Author: Mike Schoonover, Hunter Schoonover
* Date: 6/12/14
*
* Purpose:
*
* This class interfaces with a NotchCutter unit via Ethernet.
*
* Packet Format
* 
* All packets sent and received are of format:
* 
* 0xaa
* 0x55
* 0xbb
* 0x66
* command byte
* data byte 0
* data byte 1
* data byte 2
* ...
* checksum (of command and data bytes)
*
* Communication Flow 
*
* The data to and from the remotes is piped through sockets. The sockets have
* buffering and will store multiple data packets before being read. They must
* be read fast enough to prevent buffer overflow.
* 
* When using synchronous communication, the host sends a command packet and
* then waits a specified time for the return packet. If the timeout occurs
* before the expected packet arrives, the host can either ignore the failure
* or resend the packet depending on the criticality of the return packet.
* 
* One problem that occurs is that the remote might return the packet after the
* the timeout but the host has already moved on to other processing. The
* late packet will be stuck in the buffer. Therefore, for synchronous
* processing, the processDataPacketsUntilSpecifiedType method is called after
* sending a command packet as it will clear out any leftover packets in the
* buffer to reach the expected return packet.
* 
* The packets are processed by different methods specific to each packet type.
* When leftover packets are being processed, their data might be stored in
* persistent variables for later collection by the host. When the
* processDataPacketsUntilSpecifiedType method is called, the host will not get
* a chance to collect that data until later as the method does not return
* until all packets have been processed or the target packet type has been
* reached.
* 
* If multiple packets of the same type are received before the host can
* collect the data, data from earlier packets will be overwritten by later
* packets. If the data is merely for informational display, it often does not
* matter if some data is skipped.
* 
* In other cases, the handling method can store peak data such as the max
* and/or min. Thus, the important nature of the data is not lost as it is
* typical that displaying or detecting the max or min is adequate. One case is
* where the system should trigger an alarm if the value goes above or below a
* certain threshold -- the min/max values stored can be used later to check
* for the violation.
* 
* In cases where every single data point is important, the handling method can
* store the variables in an array or Collection object and the host can process
* all the values collected when it has time.
* 
* It is up to the programmer to decide which data can be skipped, which must
* have max/mins recorded, and which must be buffered so that none is lost.
* 
*  Synchronous Method
* 
* Using the synchronous method, the host sends a command packet and then waits
* a specified time for the return packet by calling 
* 
*   processDataPacketsUntilSpecifiedType
* 
* As noted above, this will force all packets in the buffer to be processed
* until the target packet type is reached.
* 
* If the remote does not respond in time, then the calling method may ignore the
* failure or may attempt to resend the command, depending on the criticality
* of success.
* 
* If constantly updating a display repeatedly from values received from the
* remote, resending may not be necessary as the update will be refreshed
* properly on the next cycle -- the old values will simply be displayed for
* one extra cycle through the loop.
* 
* On the other hand, sending a control value to the remote may be very critical
* as the value may affect operation. Thus, if the remote does not return with
* an ACK packet, it may be necessary to resend the control value. Due to the
* robust error correcting nature of TCP/IP, it may be safe to ignore the ACK
* packet anyway and just assume that communication was successful. Note that
* the ACK packet must still be waited for so that it will be cleaned from the
* buffer.
* 
*  Asynchronous Method
* 
* Using the asynchronous method, the host sends the command packet but does
* not call processOneDataPacket immediately to wait for the return packet.
* Instead, the program goes on about other business.
* 
* The processDataPackets method is called at some later time, usually by a
* thread or timer. All waiting return packets are processed at one time and
* their values stored and the appropriate "data ready" flags set so that the
* program can detect that new values are ready for use. At some point, the
* program uses the new data values for display, saving, or control. At that
* time, the "data ready" flags are cleared so the program knows not to use the
* data again until new data has been received and the flags are set again.
* 
* Which Method to Use
* 
* In general, the synchronous method is easiest to use but may not be the most
* efficient as the host must wait for the return packet each time when it
* could be performing other tasks.
* 
* Both methods may be used in the same program. Setting values in the remote
* might work best synchronously as there is usually no time issue when simply
* sending setup values. During time critical operations, the data packets
* can be requested and processed asynchronously so the host can perform other
* tasks between the request and the receive.
* 
* Adding New Remote Commands
* 
* Two different sample code sets have been included in this and the
* NotcherSimulator class to serve as examples for adding commands:
* 
*   TEST_SET_VALUE_CMD
*   TEST_PACKET_CMD
* 
* Search this class (Notcher) and NotcherSimulator for "TEST_SET_VALUE_CMD"
* to find all code related to this command. Like wise, search for
* "TEST_PACKET_CMD" for that code set.
* 
* To add a new command, make a new command send method and packet handling
* method similar to those for the appropriate example code set. Then add
* the command switch statement to processOneDataPacket to call the handler
* when the packet type is received. (Search for the phrase 
* "add more commands here" to find location to add the switch statement.)
* 
* NOTE: The process of adding a command must be repeated in NotcherSimulator,
* but with the opposite logic. The message handler handles command packets and
* returns response packets. Searching for the "TEST_SET_VALUE_CMD" and
* "TEST_PACKET_CMD" phrases in that class will also reveal the necessary code
* elements required.
*
*   TEST_SET_VALUE_CMD Code Set
* 
* The TEST_SET_VALUE_CMD is an example of an synchronous communication in
* which a value(s) are sent to the remote.
* 
* See notes at the top of sendTestSetValueCmd and handleACKPkt in this class
* for more explanation. Also see notes at the top of handleTestSetValuePkt in
* class NotcherSimulator.
* 
* Note that many similar commands may return ACK packets -- the return packet's
* command value will be set to ACK_CMD and the first data byte will be set to
* the command id of the original packet sent by the host and which is being
* acknowledged by the ACK packet. Thus the host can match the ACK packet with
* the packet which is being acknowledged.
* 
* Before calling sendTestSetValueCmd, set breakpoints at the top of 
* Notcher.processOneDataPacket and NotcherSimulator.processDataPacketsHelper to
* track the program flow. The second method (in NotcherSimulator class) will
* be called first as the simulator receives the command packet. The first
* method (Notcher.processOneDataPacket) should be called by some thread or timer
* on a regular basis so that it can handle the return packet when it arrives.
*
* Multiple Threads
* 
* If only a timer event is used in the program, then thread conflicts will not
* be a problem. If another thread is created to execute the packet handling
* code (such as by calling processDataPacketsUntilSpecifiedType), then the
* synchronize keyword must be added to some of the methods to prevent
* thread interference.
* 
* Since the new thread is collecting data and storing it in class member
* variables when the handling code is called and the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)
* is calling getter methods for those same variables, the methods must be
* tagged with the synchronize keyword.
* 
* For simplest code, synchronize can be applied to the 
*   processDataPacketsUntilSpecifiedType method and all the getters used to
* access the data variables can be declared as synchronized.
* 
* For slightly more efficient operation, each packet handler method which
* saves data from the packet into the member variables can be declared
* synchronized. This allows the EDT to use a getter when the other thread is in
* the processDataPacketsUntilSpecifiedType method. Only when the other thread
* is actually in a packet handler method will the getters be blocked.
*
* 
* Overview of Adding and Testing New Commands
* 
*    Adding a Command to Send Values to the Remote
* 
*       1) search Notcher and Notcher Simulator for the phrase "TEST_PACKET_CMD"
*           to find all code sections applicable
* 
*       2) copy and modify all applicable code sections for the new command;
*           in these instructions, your new method which mimics
*           Notcher.sendTestSetValueCmd is referred to as send***Cmd while your
*           new method which mimics NotcherSimulator.handleTestSetValuePacket is
*           referred to as handle***Packet; the actual name you use should
*           describe the packet being sent, such as "sendResetCmd"
* 
*       3) somewhere in your program, add three consecutive calls to your new
*           Notcher.send***Cmd method (the calls can be made any time after
*           Notcher.connect has completed -- in your button event code, in a
*           timer, etc.); the three calls will check to make sure the handling
*           code is cleaning the packets from the socket properly else the
*           breakpoints in the resync methods will be triggered -- REMOVE THE
*           EXTRA TWO CALLS AFTER DEBUGGING COMPLETE -- the multiple calls are
*           used only to make sure the packets are being cleaned up, if they
*           are then you will not get halts at the resync breakpoints caused
*           by leftover packet fragments
* 
*       4) place breakpoints at the top of both resync methods in the Remote
*           and Simulator classes
* 
*       5) place breakpoints in Notcher.send***Cmd, 
*           NotcherSimulator.handle***Packet and Notcher.handleACKPacket
* 
*       6) run the program
* 
*       7) the program should halt at the Notcher.send***Cmd breakpoint first;
*           the program will stop multiple times at that point, once for each
*           packet sent; step through the new method and verify its operation
*
*       8) a short time later, the program should halt at the breakpoint in
*           NotcherSimulator.handle***Packet, once for each packet sent; step
*           through the new method and verify its operation
*
*       9) the program will at some point halt at the breakpoint in
*           Notcher.handleACKPacket as Notcher object receive ACK packets from
*           the NotcherSimulator objects
* 
*       10) the breakpoints in the resync methods should NEVER halt -- if so
*           then an error has occurred with the last packet; this is usually
*           caused by reading too many or few bytes from the socket and thus
*           corrupting the data order; a resync occurs when the header of a new
*           packet is expected and is not found
